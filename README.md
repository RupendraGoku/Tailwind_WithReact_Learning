# 🌿 Nature Tour Booking Landing Page 🌿

This is a **responsive landing page** created using **React + Vite + Tailwind CSS**, inspired by a tutorial by [Hitesh Choudhary](https://www.youtube.com/@HiteshCodeLab). The project helped me understand the core concepts of **Tailwind CSS** and how to implement a clean UI in **React** following **best practices**.

## 📌 About the Project

This project is a **custom nature tourism booking landing page** built after learning Tailwind CSS through Hitesh Choudhary sir's "PW Skills" landing page tutorial. While the basic layout inspiration comes from his HTML+Tailwind tutorial, I decided to take it a step further by:

- Rebuilding it from scratch in **React + Vite**
- Creating my own theme: **Nature-themed tour booking**
- Using **reusable components**
- Leveraging `map()` for dynamic rendering of sections
- Properly structured folder organization
- Clean and responsive UI with **Tailwind CSS**
- Internal navigation using `react-router-dom`
